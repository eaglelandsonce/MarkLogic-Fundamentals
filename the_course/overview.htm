<p>For live training online, you will want to have two computers (or one computer with <strong>two monitors</strong>) so that you can see what the instructor is doing on one monitor, while you are working on the second monitor.</p>
<p>For the self-paced version of this course, you will want to do the setup steps in the self-paced course videos to ensure that your computer will be able to run the course virtual machine (downloadable from MarkLogic University) locally.</p>
<p>This course was written using a MarkLogic University virtual machine (for running on a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer), using CentOS in VirtualBox.</p>
<p>This course could also potentially  be done without the course virtual machine, directly on a Linux computer (for setup, see <a href="units/xb02_x_see_the_steps_that_were_done.htm" target="_blank">See the Steps That Were Done</a>), or on a Mac or on Windows (with adjustments as needed, such as file paths, and MarkLogic installation steps). For a list of platforms supported by MarkLogic, please see the <a href="http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/installation" target="_blank">MarkLogic Installation Guide</a>.<br>

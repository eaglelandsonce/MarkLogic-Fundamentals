<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Learning How MarkLogic Is Being Used </strong></p>
<p>As a real-time transactional database, MarkLogic is used to integrate and serve a wide variety of content for a wide variety of commercial and government applications.</p>
<p><img src="../images/unit01/running_the_apps.png" width="697" height="278" class="image-border"></p>
<p>Organizations most commonly use MarkLogic as a data hub, bringing in data from   siloed systems, harmonizing the data, and then serving it to  real-time applications. </p>

<p>For example, <strong>Chevron</strong> created a MarkLogic data hub to provide a comprehensive record of every piece of equipment  and facility they have throughout the world, bringing together disparate bits of information previously spread across many, many siloed systems. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses MarkLogic to provide access to health coverage for millions of Americans through <strong>HealthCare.gov</strong>, validating eligibility requirements for insurance plan enrollment across multiple federal data sources, and conducting thousands of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using MarkLogic for their Olympics site, the <strong>BBC</strong> and Press Association broke viewership and download records during the Olympics, processing 25,000 transactions per second and delivering 2.8 petabytes of data on the busiest day.</p>
<p><strong>Cisco</strong> uses  MarkLogic for their customer service content data hub, integrating product information, and documentation of  products, from the past 30 years, including acquisitions, to provide a google-like search for customers. </p>
<p>A <strong>Top-5 Investment Bank</strong> uses MarkLogic for a global, real-time, unified view of derivatives trades on MarkLogic. The 100,000 trades they process each day typically result in about 32 million live deals in the system at any one time, generating cash flow risks in excess of $100 million.</p>

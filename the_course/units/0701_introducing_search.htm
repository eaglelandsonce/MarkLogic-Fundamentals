<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Introducing Search</strong></p>
<p>With search included in the original design of MarkLogic, MarkLogic has powerful real-time search capabilities, including the ability to query <strong>documents</strong>, <strong>triples</strong>, and/or <strong>rows</strong>. In addition, MarkLogic offers <strong>geospatial</strong> search, as well as <strong>alerting</strong> (i.e. reverse search).</p>
<p>MarkLogic's extensive search features include <span class="exercise-step">facets, type-ahead suggestions, highlighting, snippets,  relevance ranking, document structure-based search, proximity boosting, search term weighting,  wildcards, stemming,    case sensitivity, punctuation sensitivity,  diacritic sensitivity</span>, and more.</p>
<p>For example, MarkLogic's documents, triples, and/or rows search capabilities could be used with  geospatial search capabilities to create discovery applications. These applications could even include alerting, for notification of any new items.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">Search APIs</p>
<p>For searching <strong>documents</strong>, cts.search, JSearch, search:search, the REST API /v1/search endpoint, the Java API, or the Node.js API are commonly used.</p>

<p>Each of the  search APIs above is built upon the ones below it.</p>
<p><br>
  To search <strong>triples</strong>, SPARQL or the Optic API are commonly used.</p>
<p>To search <strong>rows</strong>, SQL or the Optic API are commonly used.</p>

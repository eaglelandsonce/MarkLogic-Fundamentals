<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Learning About Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>With the release of MarkLogic 10.0-2, and further enhanced in 10.0-3, machine learning models can be run within MarkLogic, avoiding the need to export data to a third party  system, run models, and then import the results back into MarkLogic. Instead, models can be stored and run directly in MarkLogic.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">ONNX Runtime</p>
<p>As of MarkLogic 10.0-3, the   ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) Runtime is embedded in MarkLogic.</p>
<p><strong>ONNX</strong> is a open  format for machine learning models, providing an open standard for moving models between the various framework technologies.</p>
<p><br>

<p>With the ONNX Runtime embedded in MarkLogic 10.0-3, different development teams in an organization may each use different machine learning frameworks to create their models. By  each exporting their model into the ONNX format, their model can be used in MarkLogic.</p>
<p>MarkLogic 10.0-2 embedded the CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit) libraries, which are now deprecated, in favor of  ONNX Runtime.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">Using Machine Learning</p>
<p>Machine learning is commonly used for prediction or classification, which can be accomplished by creating a model, providing data to train the model, and then using the model. </p>
<p>For example, training data might be provided to a model for predicting home world. </p>

Along with developers  being able to store and run machine learning models  in MarkLogic,   MarkLogic will be taking advantage of machine learning to enhance various aspects of the product itself, such as smarter mastering, autonomous elasticity, predictive query optimization, and proactive curation and governance.</p>

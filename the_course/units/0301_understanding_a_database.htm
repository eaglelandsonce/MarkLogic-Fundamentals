<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding a Database</strong></p>
<p>In MarkLogic, a database is a set of configurations, which includes a  reference to one or more forests. </p>
<p>A <strong>forest</strong> is where the documents in a database are physically stored. A forest refers to a directory on the file system. <br>
  <br>

<p>The word forest comes from the concept of XML documents having tree-like structures (which is how MarkLogic started). Hence, the idea of  storing trees in forests. Although the directory location for MarkLogic data is called a forest,  MarkLogic can store documents that are in any of the supported file formats (i.e. JSON, XML, text, or binary) in a forest.<br>
</p>
<p>A forest can only be attached to one database, but a  <strong>database can have more than one forest attached to it</strong>, which is common (e.g. to expand database capacity).</p>
<p>Sizing recommendations (e.g. 2 cores per forest, maximum of 256GB per forest) are available in the Scalability, Availability, and Failover Guide at docs.marklogic.com/guide/cluster/scalability.</p>
<p><strong>Documents cannot be loaded into a database until the database has at least one  forest attached to it.</strong></p>

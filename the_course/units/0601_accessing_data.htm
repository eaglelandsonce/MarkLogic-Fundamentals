<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Accessing Data</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to access data in a MarkLogic database. Programming interfaces available for accessing data include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>REST API</li>
  <li>Java API</li>
  <li>Node.js API</li>
  <li>JavaScript </li>
  <li>XQuery </li>
  <li>XCC</li>
  <li>SPARQL</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Data Services</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
The <strong>REST API </strong>provides a programming language-agnostic way to read documents from a MarkLogic database.</p>
<p>The <strong>Java API </strong>provides an interface for Java developers to communicate with a MarkLogic database.</p>
<p>The <strong>Node.js API </strong>provides an interface for Node.js developers to communicate with a MarkLogic database.</p>
<p>As a native language in MarkLogic, <strong>JavaScript</strong> can be used to read documents from a MarkLogic database, as well as serve data via custom REST API endpoints. </p>
<p>As a native language in MarkLogic, <strong>XQuery</strong> can be used to read documents from a MarkLogic database, as well as serve data via custom REST API endpoints, as well as create applications that can be hosted by MarkLogic.</p>
<p><strong>XCC</strong> is an older, low-level interface that Java and .NET applications used in the past to communicate with a MarkLogic database. (Nowadays, the Java API and the REST API are commonly used in place of XCC.)</p>
<p><strong>SPARQL</strong> is common for accessing triples data. </p>
<p>By exposing document data as rows, <strong>SQL</strong> queries can be made. </p>
<p><strong>Data Services</strong> (a.k.a. microservices) can be created to make it easy for developers outside of MarkLogic to make custom data calls. For example, providing a Java developer with custom methods for accessing  data, without the Java developer  needing to understand MarkLogic. </p>

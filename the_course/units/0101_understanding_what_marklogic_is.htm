<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding MarkLogic</strong></p>
<p>MarkLogic, formally known as MarkLogic Server, is an <strong>enterprise NoSQL database</strong> that is commonly used for creating a <strong>data hub</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NoSQL</strong> database features (in MarkLogic, in most NoSQL database technologies):</p>
<ul>
  <li>No schema required</li>
  <li>Horizontal scalability </li>
  <li>High availability</li>
</ul>
<p>MarkLogic includes broad    support for data,  unstructured to structured, including JSON, XML, RDF (for semantic triples), text, and binary  data types.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise</strong> features (in MarkLogic, not in  most other NoSQL database technologies):</p>
<ul>
  <li>ACID transactions</li>
  <li>Certified security</li>
  <li>Built-in search</li>
</ul>
<p>Although MarkLogic differs from a relational database in that MarkLogic was designed to not have  schema requirements for data, and was designed for  huge horizontal scalability on commodity hardware, it is similar to relational databases in that it is for  mission-critical, <strong>real-time</strong> applications.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading"> MarkLogic Data Hub</p>
<p>MarkLogic Data Hub is a platform that can be installed on MarkLogic Server, providing a data integration  framework for importing and curating data from a wide variety of sources (e.g. silos). </p>
<p>Along with MarkLogic Data Hub's data loading and curation capabilities are the ability to preserve data lineage, do entity mapping, do smart mastering, and control data security.</p>
<p>Documentation on MarkLogic Data Hub is available at <strong>docs.marklogic.com/datahub</strong>.</p>
<p>For an overview and demonstration of MarkLogic Data Hub, see <strong>www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7crDMe4vPA</strong>.</p>

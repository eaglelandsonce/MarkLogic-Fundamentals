<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Getting Started With How It Works</strong></p>
<p>MarkLogic Server is often used in a cluster, to provide <strong>scalability</strong> and <strong>high availability</strong>. Each node in a MarkLogic cluster has the same capabilities. There are no master or slave nodes. With each node having full capabilities, it makes it easy to scale a cluster, adding nodes as needed, or to remove nodes, if no longer needed.</p>
<p>Documents in a <strong>wide variety of formats and structure</strong> can be ingested and immediately searched, using MarkLogic's built-in search and indexing. MarkLogic's built-in search and indexing  provides lightning-fast, sub-second search results across the data, and includes a range of search features including full-text search, stemming, type-ahead suggestions, proximity searches, snippets, highlighting, structure-aware, co-occurrence relationships, facets,  geospatial,  semantic inferencing, as well as support for multi-lingual content.</p>
<p>MarkLogic's support for MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) results in <strong>ACID transactions</strong>, even at massive scale. </p>
<p>With NIAP Common Criteria certification, MarkLogic has the highest <strong>security</strong> certification of any NoSQL database, providing fine-grained security at the  configuration, database, document, and  element levels.</p>
<p>For application developers, MarkLogic provides a  <strong>REST API</strong>, <strong>Java API</strong>, and <strong>Node.js API</strong>, as well as   the ability to host applications built in <strong>XQuery</strong> or <strong>JavaScript</strong>, MarkLogic's two native programming languages. With the REST API supporting any language that can make HTTP requests, application code written in the vast majority of programming languages (e.g. <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, etc.) can communicate with a MarkLogic database. </p>
